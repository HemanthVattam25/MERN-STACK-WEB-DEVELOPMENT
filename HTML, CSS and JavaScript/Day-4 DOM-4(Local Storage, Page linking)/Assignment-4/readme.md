1.  BMI Calculator
    Create an application which calculates BMI (Body Mass Index)
    Your app should have 2 input boxes
    Take weight in kgs from user
    Take height in meters from user
    Based on entered height and weight calculate BMI of that person
    Here is the formula for manually calculating BMI BMI = (weight) / (height
    height)
    From the obtained BMI result, display whether the person is
    UnderWeight- bmi <= 18.4
    Normal Weight- bmi >= 18.5 && bmi <= 24.9
    Overweight- bmi >= 25 && bmi <= 29.9
    Obese- bmi >= 30
    Hint: use If conditions

2.  Create the file leaderboard.html so that it looks similar to the image below
    Functionality
    By clicking on any number it shows up in the score box joined to any previous
    numbers already present (Eg: To enter a score of 423 you have to press 4 2 3)
    Once the button ENTER is pressed the score gets compared with the MIN and
    MAX boxes, if the current score is less than the MIN score it gets updated with the
    current score, if the current score is greater than the MAX score it gets updated
    with the current score
    The SCORE box will be reset with empty value
